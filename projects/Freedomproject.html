            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>My freedom project details the basics of customer service, its current software and hardware, and my own idea for a future innovation called SERVCEE. After I received feedback and other opinions from classmates, I came to the conclusion that a joint service software or essentially a more professional reddit would be greatly beneficial to forming a healthy company/employee/customer relationship. The way it would work is that a community can give feedback and provide a safer and quicker service. In regards to long waiting lines in service calls, it would be beneficial for both the customer and employee and make service more accessible. Mixing the fundamentals of these ideas can help provide the most effective platform for workers and service agents. SERVCEE is essentially a mix of fiverr, google maps, yelp, yahoo, and reddit to create a professional platform for my three audiences, the employee, customer, and entrepreneur.</p>
            <p> This project was really fun in my opinion, and i felt really passionate when making it. I had struggles when forming an innovation for my topic, especially since it was more reliant on social concepts rather than something that can be assisted technology. My takeaway from this challenge was that a more better way to creatively innovate something is to study your topic and investigate current solutions to use as inspiration. I solved my first  challenge by referencing solutions to the problems of similar topics to provide a new, yet familiar innovation to customer service. Another challenge i had when coding was with making my website less wordy. In order to solve this problem, i used feedback from my peers to add more images, visuals, and interactive aspects to my website. My final takeaway from this challenge was that peer feedback is extrememly important. A bonus challenge i had was when making </p>
